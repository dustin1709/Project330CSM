	and also updates that user's password with the temporary one with an expiration of 5 minutes

v 4.6
  - Not sure what happened, but the code was broken - did not compile. Now it at least compiles. (Looks like someone overwrote my code again!).
  - moved *.jar files to the "libs" folder
  - Update .runme.sh to reflect the jar files location change
  - Updated DLUser.java to make resetPassword static
  - Updated User.java to reflect changes in DLUser.java
  - DLUser.resetPassword was setting expiration date incorrectly (wrong timezone?), was not hashing temp password, was not checking for email actually existing.
    (Right now it compiles and logs in with the password received in the email [email address is set in TestUser.java])
v 4.7
  - Added javax.json-api-1.1.4.jar to the "libs" folder
